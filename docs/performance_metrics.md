# Performance Metrics
EMOTIV provides six basic measures of mental performance, derived directly from your mental activity. Each measure is automatically scaled to suit your normal range and base level of each condition – the system learns your usual state and capabilities and provides an adjusted value showing your relative performance on each occasion, compared to your overall behavior. 

Performance metrics graphs include 6 metrics for INSIGHT, EPOC X and EPOC+ headsets:

- Stress (FRU) is a measure of comfort with the current challenge. High stress can result from an inability to complete a difficult task, feeling overwhelmed and fearing negative consequences for failing to satisfy the task requirements. Generally a low to moderate level of stress can improve productivity, whereas a higher level tends to be destructive and can have long term consequences for health and wellbeing.
- Engagement (ENG) is experienced as alertness and the conscious direction of attention towards task-relevant stimuli. It measures the level of immersion in the moment and is a mixture of attention and concentration and contrasts with boredom. Engagement is characterized by increased physiological arousal and beta waves along with attenuated alpha waves. The greater the attention, focus, and workload, the greater the output score reported by the detection.
- Interest (VAL) is the degree of attraction or aversion to the current stimuli, environment or activity and is commonly referred to as Valence. Low interest scores indicate a strong aversion to the task, high interest indicates a strong affinity with the task while mid-range scores indicate you neither like nor dislike the activity.
- Excitement (EXC) is an awareness or feeling of physiological arousal with a positive value. It is characterized by activation in the sympathetic nervous system which results in a range of physiological responses including pupil dilation, eye widening, sweat gland stimulation, heart rate and muscle tension increases, blood diversion, and digestive inhibition. In general, the greater the increase in physiological arousal the greater the output score for the detection. The Excitement detection is tuned to provide output scores that reflect short-term changes in excitement over time periods as short as several seconds.
- Focus (FOC) is a measure of fixed attention to one specific task. Focus measures the depth of attention as well as the frequency that attention switches between tasks. A high level of task switching is an indication of poor focus and distraction.
- Relaxation (MED) is a measure of an ability to switch off and recover from intense concentration. Trained meditators can score extremely high relaxation scores.


## How accurate is your detection?
Our detections vary in accuracy. Each detection has its own ‘accuracy’ figure and indeed the accuracy expressed is an average across users, therefore for some people the detection is more accurate than the quoted figure and for others the accuracy is less.

Mental Command can achieve very high accuracy for a single command and the accuracy becomes less when more actions are added. But in this case the accuracy is also strongly dependent on the user’s skill level and ability to remember the mental state used in training.

Performance Metric detections vary significantly. Excitement is very accurate, Frustration and Engagement a little less and Meditation covers some types of meditation quite well and others less so (for example, meditation styles may have high or low cognitive involvement).

Overall our accuracy is determined by an index calculated within specified time segments. A True Positive (TP) is a correct activation of an event, True Negative (TN) is a period of time where no actions are attempted and none are detected, and False Negatives (FN) and False Positives (FP) are failures to trigger in the required period, or a trigger occurring incorrectly. Accuracy is determined by (TP+TN)/(TP+FP+TN+FN)
Measurement accuracy of the device is technically: minimum voltage resolution 0.51uV, 14 bit accuracy, 0.2-43Hz bandwidth.
